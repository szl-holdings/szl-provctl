# Changelog

## 2026-09-29

- Retire the one-shot Hub joblib quarantine writer (`hub-joblib-quarantine.yml`,
  `scripts/hub_quarantine_joblib.py`). The live Hub model and kernel repos hold no
  `model.joblib`, and the workflow was an unlocked Hub writer with an
  `HF_TOKEN || HF_ORG_TOKEN` fallback. The source-side refusal of joblib, pickle and
  dill loaders is unchanged. `tests/test_hub_single_writer.py` now fails if any file
  here gains a Hub write path outside a committed mirror.

## 2026-08-28

- Quarantine joblib/pickle: forge no longer dumps `model.joblib`; eval refuses the file; Hub deletion is a dispatched PR with exact parent commit.
Honesty README. No kernel math changed.
